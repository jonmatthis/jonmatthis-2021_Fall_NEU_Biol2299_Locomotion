Ischer, T., Ireland, K., & Booth, D. T. (2009). Locomotion performance of green turtle hatchlings from the Heron Island Rookery, Great Barrier Reef. _Marine Biology_, _156_(7), 1399â€“1409. [[https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-009-1180-7]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-009-1180-7)

The paper is about how " [[nest]] " temperature effects the performance of baby green [[turtles]]. The paper tested their [[swimming]], and crawling performance by measuring the rate of strokes, and mean speed. This is all in the hopes of figuring out if [[nest]] temperature could have an effect on a [[baby]] green [[turtle]]'s [[survival rate]].
