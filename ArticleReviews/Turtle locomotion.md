Ischer, T., Ireland, K., & Booth, D. T. (2009). Locomotion performance of green turtle hatchlings from the Heron Island Rookery, Great Barrier Reef. _Marine Biology_, _156_(7), 1399–1409. [[https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-009-1180-7]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00227-009-1180-7)

The paper is about how " [[**nest**]] " temperature effects the performance of baby green [[**turtles**]]. The paper tested their [[**swimming**]], and crawling performance by measuring the rate of strokes, and mean speed. This is all in the hopes of figuring out if [[nest]] temperature could have an effect on a [[baby]] green [[turtle]]'s [[**survival rate**]].
