# Emperor Penguin Locomotion

## Summary
This paper is about [[anaerobic energy stores]] and [[swimming stroke rates]] in [[emperor penguins]] during dives. Stroke rates measured indicate [[muscle workload]] is not constant throughout the dive as was previously assumed, and that energy stores play an important role in the penguins' abilities to perform long dives.
