# Poster Proposal
This paper is about the locomotion of the basilisk lizard.  They studied these lizards as they [[ran across]] water and developed a [[hydrodynamic]] model through observing high-speed [[video]] of the lizards.  The question they sought to answer was: "How are basilisk lizards able to support their [[weight]] while running on water?".
