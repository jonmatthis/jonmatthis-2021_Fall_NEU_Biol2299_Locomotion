### Summary
Reconstructed [[plesiosaur]] flippers were made from fossils in order to determine which [[limb]] movements would result in the most effective [[propulsion]]. It was found that the hind [[flippers]] worked more efficiently when working with the front flippers which answers the question about the propulsion style of thes [[reptiles]].
