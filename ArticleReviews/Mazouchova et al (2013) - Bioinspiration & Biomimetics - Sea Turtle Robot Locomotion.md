### Summary: 
To observe and learn about [[flipper-based]] [[terrestrial]] locomotion, a robot based on sea [[turtle hatchlings]] was built and [[observed]] in motion. A variety of different variables were changed throughout to create a number of different [[gaits]] and scenarios, to help explain differences in hatchling [[survival]] and [[performance]].
