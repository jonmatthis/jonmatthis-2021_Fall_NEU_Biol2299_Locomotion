### Summary

Researchers found that [[Two-toed sloths]] have a large range of speeds in their movements. They found that their [[intralimb movements]] are still very similar to other [[promograde mammals]]. In contrast, they found that there are great adjustments in the feet and [[hand joints]], affecting the [[kinematics]] of [[fore- and hindlimb]].
