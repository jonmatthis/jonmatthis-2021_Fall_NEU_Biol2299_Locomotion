### Summary:
This paper tested if [[newborns]], only two days old, could crawl ([[quadrupedal locomotion]]) with the help of different tools to relieve their weight. The [[apparatuses]] eliminated the heavy weight a newborn carries on their head and torso so that they could focus primarily on their ability to move. The article concludes that they could in-fact do so, thus the researchers concluded that the ability to crawl is developed during the [[fetal stage]] and that early training in crawling can stimulate faster achievement of [[walking]] independently.
