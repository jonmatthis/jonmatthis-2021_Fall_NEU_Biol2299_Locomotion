### Summary
This paper is about how [[dogs]] adapt from [[quadrupedal]] [[locomotion]] to [[tripedal]] locomotion. They stimulated the loss of the right [[pelvic limb]] using an [[Ehmer sling]], and had nine healthy dogs run on a [[treadmill]]. Angles at touch-down and lift-off, minimum and maximum joint angles, and [[range of motion]] are the main parameters used while observing the movements of these dogs.
