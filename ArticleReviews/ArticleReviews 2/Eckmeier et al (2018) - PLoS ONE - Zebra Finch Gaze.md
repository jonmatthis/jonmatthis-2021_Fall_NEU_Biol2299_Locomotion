### Summary

The authors were interested in the [[visual control]] of [[zebra finch]] flight. They had the [[birds]] fly while avoiding an obstacle while being recorded by two high speed [[cameras]]. They manually tracked beak orientation and found [[saccade]] like head movements. They interpret this in the [[optic flow]] space,  but I think they are problematically neglecting to consider that they aren't *actually* recording [[eye movements]].
