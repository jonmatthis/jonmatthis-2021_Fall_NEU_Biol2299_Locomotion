# H2 **Summary**
 In four strains of [[mice]], the effect of cocaine concentration within a [[Y-maze activity]] was measured. More specifically, the 3 researchers James A.Ruth, Elizabeth A.Ullman, Allan C.Collins, studied the effect of [[cocaine]] on the [[heart rate]] of mice, determining a slight decrease in the [[heart]] rate at a specific concentration of the drug. It was found that there was a [[genetic difference]] between the strains of mice, causing slightly different  sensitivities.
