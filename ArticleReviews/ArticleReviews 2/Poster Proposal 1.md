# Summary:
Ophiocordyceps pseudolloydii [[fungus]] species were found to infect  Dolichoderus thoracicus ants in forests (in central Taiwan). Some fungus species act as parasites and cause the ants to behave like [[zombies]], making them walk abnormally and climb the undersides of plant leaves. The direction of canopy openings and the orientation of the zombie [[ant]]'s heads were directly correlated, and indicated that the [[sun]] plays an important role in the movement of the zombie ants.
