[Dual function of the pectoral girdle for feeding and locomotion in white-spotted bamboo sharks | Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences (royalsocietypublishing.org)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2017.0847) 

### Summary
This paper shows how the [[white-spotted bamboo sharks]] use their [[pectoral fin]] for both [[feeding]] and [[movement]]. This is because sharks have their pectoral fin located on completely separate from the skull, which is different than the placement in ray-finned fish. The research looked at how much the fin moves and when it moves, to show how it is used for both of the functions listed above.
