## Locomotion in Parkinson's Disease: Neuronal Coupling of Upper and Lower Limbs

+ Dietz, V., & Michel, J. (2008). Locomotion in Parkinson’s disease: Neuronal coupling of upper and lower limbs. _Brain_, _131_(12), 3421–3431. [https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awn263](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awn263)

Subjects with [[Parkinson's Disease]] walked on a treadmill with an object approaching them. [[Spinal reflex]] responses were larger before avoiding the [[obstacle]] than avoiding it. Obstacle stepping was worse in subjects with Parkinson's than the control, which concluded [[quadrupedal limb coordination]] is preserved.
