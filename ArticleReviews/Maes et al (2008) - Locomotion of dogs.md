## Summary
This paper is about the [[symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits]] of [[dogs]] (specifically Belgian shepherds) and the quantified relationship between [[temporal]] and [[spatial]] [[limb]] coordination using [[anteroposterior sequence analysis]]. The walk to rotary [[gallop]] was continuous throughout the sequences, but there was an increase in swing duration at very high speeds, showing stride length as a main contributor. The relationship between spatial and temporal [[coordination]] was linked to speed and trunk length.
