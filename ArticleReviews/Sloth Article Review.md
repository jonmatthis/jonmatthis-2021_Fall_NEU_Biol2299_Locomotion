### Summary 

The authors were interested in the [[locomotion]] of the two-toed sloth. There was used detailed [[videoradiographic]] analysis of various aspects of the two-toed sloth's locomotion including: [[spatio-temperal]] gait parameters, data on [[interlimb coordination]], and [[limb kinematics]]. The two-toed sloth showed great variation in spatio-temporal [[gait]] parameters over the observed range in [[speed]]. In contrast, [[limb]] kinematics were observed as 'normal'.
