## Summary:

In this paper, the scientists observed [[platypuses]] walking on treadmills at different speeds and recorded their [[oxygen consumption]], [[stride frequency]], [[gait]], etc. They then used the data they took to determine the [[metabolic cost]] of [[terrestrial motion]], which was relatively high for platypuses. This, combined with general observations about how they moved, suggested that their terrestrial motion is hindered because of the specific [[adaptations]] they have made to move in the water [[efficiently]].
