The paper is about how even though [hummingbird] locomotion uses the most energy as opposed to other forms of animal locomotion and flying at [high elevations] is very difficult because of air density and oxygen level changes, hummingbirds are still found in abundance at high elevations. It experiments with flight tests varying [wing size] and [wing stroke amplitude]. It shows data from 43 hummingbird species in the [Andes region].
