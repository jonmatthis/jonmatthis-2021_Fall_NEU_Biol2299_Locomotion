### Summary

#### This paper is about the first quantitative data taken on the [[locomotion]] of [[hoatzins]], using [[motion capture]] [[cameras]] and measurements inside [[laboratory environments]]. The research focus is on limb [[movement patterns]] and use of [[claws]] for grip, both on land and in water. Nestlings' unique [[quadrupedal]] [[coordination]] suggests recent evolutionary development in the species, and is a reflection of their [[central nervous system]]'s plasticity.
