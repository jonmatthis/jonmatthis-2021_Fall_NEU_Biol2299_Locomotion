## Summary
This paper is about the [[symmetrical and asymmetrical gaits]] of dogs (specifically Belgian shepherds) and the quantified relationship between temporal and spatial limb coordination using [[anteroposterior sequence analysis]]. The walk to rotary gallop was continuous throughout the sequences, but there was an increase in swing duration at very high speeds, showing stride length as a main contributor. The relationship between spatial and temporal coordination was linked to speed and trunk length.
