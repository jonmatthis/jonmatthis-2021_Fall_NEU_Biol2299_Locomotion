Setogawa, S., Yamaura, H., Arasaki, T., Endo, S., & Yanagihara, D. (2015). Deficits in memory-guided limb movements impair obstacle avoidance locomotion in Alzheimerâ€™s disease mouse model. _Scientific Reports_, _4_(1), 7220. [https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07220](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep07220)

How [[Alzheimer's]] affect memory and how that relates to tripping in alzheimers patients. THey used transgenic [[mouse]] models to look at [[obstacle avoidance]] bhaviors and found that the AD model mice peformed worse on the [[locomotion]] task.
