### Summary
      
This study experiments the slithering [[motion]] of [[snake]]s on flat surfaces. It is observed that the [[slithering]] locomotion of snakes is greatly affected by the frictional abilities of their scales and their lateral [[weight distribution]]. This contradicts previous studies which suggests that the [[slithering]] motion is caused by snakes laterally pushing against their surface. Therefore, this experiment demonstrates a theoretical model that focuses on the [[friction]] and weight distribution of snakes.
