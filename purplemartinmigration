Consistent range-wide pattern in fall migration strategy of Purple Martin ( _Progne subis_ ), despite different migration routes at the Gulf of Mexico. _The Auk_, _130_(2), 291â€“296. https://doi.org/10.1525/auk.2013.12225
### Summary
91 [[purple martin birds]] were tracked as they [[migrated]] from the northeast to latin america. It was found that they all took around the same length of time to [[migrate]] and [[traveled]] very fast aside from stopping in some [[locations]] to breed. This was surprising as researchers thought that the length of [[travel]] would vary depending on whether the birds crossed the Gulf of Mexico or [[flew]] around.
